**😄 Facial Expression Recognition**

This project implements a **Facial Expression Recognition** system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **PyTorch**.  
It detects emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, and more — from static images as well as in **real-time via webcam** using OpenCV.
